            <h2>My Name is Atiqur Rahman</h2>
            <p>From my childhood I wanted to study in technology area, but for some valid reason I did not do that. Whenever I have known about programming, my interest is growing on that and I was seraching that how can I learn this within short time. When I found programming hero web development course that time I feel that dream comes true. This is not easy for me to learn web development from non CSE background. If I want to achieve my goal I have to work harder than anything else. I leave my job and I am giving full time to achieve my goal. I am trying my level best and stay focused on learning. Sometime I feel tired but I make myself motivated with remembering my past life. So, I think I can do anything to build my career and be success in life.</p>
